# Simple Loan Calculator

This is a simple loan calculator made as part of an engineering technical task for Oneiro Solutions Ltd.

The task was to make a console application that is capable of calculating daily simple interest given some input.

## üßê Simple Interest

- Simple interest is calculated by multiplying loan principal by the interest rate and then by the term of a loan.
  - `Daily Interest Rate` x `Principal Amount` x `Number of Days Elapsed`
  - Simple Interest = P √ó r √ó n
    - where:
      - P = Principal
      - r = Interest rate
      - n = Term of loan
- Simple interest involves no calculation of compound interest.
  - Neither compounding interest nor calculation of the interest rate against a growing total balance is involved.
- Daily Simple Interest
  - Simple Interest is similar to Daily Simple Interest except that with the latter, interest accrues daily and is added to your account balance.
  - Also, while loan balances on simple interest debt are reduced on the payment due date, daily simple interest loan balances are reduced on the day payments are received.
